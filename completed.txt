I have finished steps 1 through 3, as well as half of step 4 (redirections).
I was unable to complete the piping of commands due to lack of time.  

I have tested this code significantly in order to ensure
proper behavior as well as ensure there are no memory leaks.

Test case protocol here:

The below test cases should be run after starting the executable myShell

Test case 1 (Working with absolute paths)-
/bin/ls
/bins/ls /home/ksd15
/bin/ls -l
/bin/ls -l /home/ksd15
exit

Test case 2 (Searching for programs in PATH)-
ls
ls -l
ls -l /home/ksd15
exit

Test case 3 (Arbitray whitespace between arguments)
ls                  -l
ls        -l       /home/ksd15
exit

Test case 4 (Running my own executable from myShell)-
../92_dedup/dedup ../92_dedup
exit

Test case 5 (Blank input)-
[empty input, just press enter]
exit

Test case 6 (Garbage input for command)-
blah blah boooooo 10101010
abcdefg this is not a real program
exit

Test case 7 (Changing directories)-
pwd
cd ..
cd ..
cd /home/ksd15
cd /home/ksd15/ece551
ls
ls -l
pwd
exit

Test case 8 (Accounting for escaped spaces in command arguments)-
mkdir a\ b\ c
cd a\ b\ c
pwd
exit

Test case 9 (Changing into directory that does not exit)-
pwd
cd /madeup_dir
cd ..
exit

Test case 10 (Working with pushd, popd, and dirstack)-
pwd
cd ..
pushd /home
cd /home/ksd15/ece551/92_dedup
pushd /home/ksd15
dirstack
popd
dirstack
pwd
popd
dirstack
exit

Test case 11 (Exiting while dirstack is not empty)-
pwd
cd ..
pushd /home
cd /home/ksd15/ece551/92_dedup
pushd /home/ksd15
dirstack
exit

Test case 12 (Try to popd with empty directory stack)-
popd
exit

Test case 13 (Standard Output redirection)-
ls -l > out.txt
cat out.txt
exit

Test case 14 (Standard Error redirection)-
ls -l someMadeUpFile 2> out.txt
cat out.txt
exit

Test case 15 (Standard Output and Input redirection)-
echo "Testing" > out.txt
cat < out.txt
exit

Test case 16 (Standard Output and Input redirection 2)-
echo "Testing" > out.txt
cat < out.txt > out2.txt
exit
